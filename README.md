# 🦒 Giraffe Planner

A playful full-stack productivity web app built with **React + Flask + SQLite**.  
Helps you plan tasks, track daily check-ins, and visualize progress — all in a cute giraffe theme.

## ✨ Features
- User authentication (JWT)
- Task management (create/update/delete, deadlines, categories)
- Daily check-ins with streaks
- Statistics dashboard (weekly trends, task types, overdue tasks)
- Pomodoro timer & “study buddy” (coming soon!)
- **In progress**: study buddy (学习搭子) and language switch (中/EN).  
  Currently only Chinese pages are available.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Recharts, Day.js  
- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-CORS  
- **Database**: SQLite (with WAL)  
- **Deployment**: Render (Web Service + Static Site)

## 🚀 Deployment
- Backend: Flask API on Render  
- Frontend: React static site on Render  
- Configurable via `.env.production` and Render environment variables

## 📚 Why this project?
This is my first full-stack project — I built it to learn React + Flask integration, and to create a fun tool for task planning.
